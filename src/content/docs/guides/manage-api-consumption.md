This document explains how to effectively manage API consumption using the Azure OpenAI Token Limit policy.

## Overview

Azure API Management offers a Token Limit policy, which allows you to set and monitor token consumption limits in tokens-per-minute (TPM). This helps ensure fair and efficient utilization of OpenAI resources, especially critical when dealing with sudden spikes in demand.

## Key Features

1. **Precise Control**: You can impose token-based limits on different counter keys, such as Subscription key or IP Address, tailoring the enforcement to specific use cases.

2. **Real-Time Monitoring**: The policy allows for real-time token usage monitoring, as metrics are returned from the OpenAI endpoint. This ensures accurate enforcement of limits.

3. **Pre-Calculation of Tokens**: Tokens can be pre-calculated on the Azure API Management side, preventing unnecessary requests to the OpenAI backend once limits are exceeded.

4. **Enhanced Customization**: Policies support various headers and variables such as tokens-consumed and remaining-tokens, allowing for granular control and reporting.

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Define Token Limits

- Determine your use case-specific limits (e.g., tokens-per-minute per Subscription key or IP Address).

### Step 2: Apply the Policy

- Implement the Token Limit policy within your API Management instance, specifying the desired limits.

### Step 3: Monitor in Real-Time

- Utilize real-time metrics to monitor token consumption and adjust settings as necessary.

### Step 4: Customize Headers and Variables

- Use customization features to adapt responses, such as including headers with usage statistics.

## Example Policy

Here is a sample policy configuration:

```xml
<policies>
    <inbound>
        <rate-limit-by-key calls="100" renewal-period="60">
            <key value="@(context.Subscription.Key)" />
            <counter-key-type>Subscription</counter-key-type>
        </rate-limit-by-key>
        <set-variable name="tokens-consumed" value="@(context.Request.TokenAmount)" />
    </inbound>
    <backend>
        <base />
    </backend>
    <outbound>
        <base />
        <set-header name="X-Tokens-Consumed" exists-action="override">
            <value>@(context.Variables["tokens-consumed"])</value>
        </set-header>
    </outbound>
    <on-error>
        <base />
    </on-error>
</policies>
```

## Best Practices

- **Adjust and Test Limits**: Regularly review and adjust token limits to align with business goals and usage patterns.
- **Integrate with Monitoring Tools**: Use external monitoring tools for enhanced observability.
- **Combine with Other Policies**: Leverage additional API Management policies such as caching or transformation for optimized performance.
